# Transitioning to updated plans
{: #transition-plans}

In 2023, the original {{site.data.keyword.cis_full}} plans are being updated to reflect new plans and associated features.
{: shortdesc}

Migrating from one plan to another is considered a modification of an existing resource, and not a destruction or creation of a resource.
{: note}

## Transitioning from a Standard plan to a Standard Next plan
{: #transitioning-next-plan}

Starting 30 April 2023, the {{site.data.keyword.cis_short_notm}} current Standard plan will no longer be available for new instances. Any instance that is created on or after this date will use the Standard Next plan.

By moving to a more metered model, the base cost of the Standard Next plan is smaller than the original Standard plans. The following table shows what changed from the Standard to the Standard Next plans.

|Feature|Standard|Standard Next|Overage|
