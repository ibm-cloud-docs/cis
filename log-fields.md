# Accessing log fields
{: #log-fields}

If `fields` are not specified in the request, a limited set of default fields are returned. Find the full list of all available fields using the following request.

```sh
ibmcloud cis logpush-available-fields DNS_DOMAIN_ID [--dataset DATASET] [-i, --instance INSTANCE]
```
{: pre}

## Datasets
{: #log-datasets}

These available datasets describe the fields available by log category:

- HTTP/ HTTPS requests (`http_requests`)
- Firewall events (`firewall_events`)
- Range events (`range_events`)
- DNS logs (`dns_logs`)

## Available Fields
{: #logpull-available-fields}

The following tables indicate the fields available by dataset. Log fields are subject to change, so it is recommended to use the [Available Log Fields API](/apidocs/cis#list-fields-for-dataset-v2) to pull the most up-to-date version of the available fields.

Specifically, this measures the wall-clock time that the JavaScript context remained open. For example, when returning a response with a large body, the Edge functions runtime can, in some cases, determine that no more JavaScript needs to run, and closes the JS context before all the bytes have passed through and been sent. Alternatively, if you use the `waitUntil()` API to perform work without blocking the return of a response, this work may continue executing after the response has been returned, and will be included in `Edge functionWallTimeUs`.|int|
