Here are some common error messages you or your support team might see:

| Error Code | Reason |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| 1001 | DNS Resolution Error. Either the customer recently signed up and their DNS information has not yet propagated, or whomever is managing the DNS has a failure. |
| 521 | Origin web server refused connection from {{site.data.keyword.cis_short_notm}}. Either the origin web server is not running, or something is blocking {{site.data.keyword.cis_short_notm}} IP addresses. |
| 522 | Connection timeout to the origin server (30 second default). Either CIS might be rate-limited, the web server could be consuming all resources (shared server), or there might be network connectivity issues between the web server and {{site.data.keyword.cis_short_notm}}. |
| 523 | Origin server is unreachable. Ensure that the origin IP address for the DNS record is the same as the one appearing in the {{site.data.keyword.cis_short_notm}} DNS Settings page. |
| 524 | {{site.data.keyword.cis_short_notm}} could make a TCP connection but did not receive a response from the web server. A long-running application or database query is interfering. |
