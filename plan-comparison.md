# Comparing CIS plans
{: #cis-plan-comparison}

{{site.data.keyword.cis_full}} offers several plans to choose from: no-cost Trial, Standard Next, and Enterprise Tier variations.
{: shortdesc}

The no-cost Trial plan is the same as the Standard Next plan, except that it expires after 30 days. Only one trial is available per account. After the Trial plan expires, it is automatically subject to reclamation.
{: note}

The numbers in these tables are quotas or resource limits for the associated feature. Features are pay-as-you-go, except for Trial and Standard Next plans.
{: tip}

The following table compares each offering to help you choose the one that's right for you. Enterprise Tier plans are available with different pricing models.

## Additional details
{: #additional-details}

* Traffic is protected when it is traffic through proxied CIS components, metered as traffic from the edge to the origin
* HTTP request made on proxied resources (for example, DNS records and load balancers) count toward your protected traffic
* When traffic is not proxied, it will only consume DNS queries during hostname resolution
