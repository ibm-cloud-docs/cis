# Administrative best practices

IBM Cloud CIS provides many ways you can administer your brand presence, your account security, and your support process. We recommend working through each of the administrative best practices listed in this document, to ensure that your customers and your content are best served by your CIS network.

**Recommendations and best practices:**

* Manage your brand by customizing CIS pages
* Enforce 2-Factor Authentication for your entire organization 
* Submit a test support ticket

## Manage your brand by customizing CIS pages
CIS must show content to your end-users occasionally. This content can include security challenge pages, block pages, and error pages. You can customize any of this content to create a consistent branding experience for your customers.

Here are two ways to customize your CIS pages:

1. **Domain-Wide:** Within the settings of each domain, you can go to the **Customize** application to change the default pages for any page we could potentially show your users.

2. **Organization-Wide:** If you have many domains within your CIS account and you'd like to create Custom pages for all of them, you can do so within your **Organization** settings.

## Enforce 2-factor authentication across your entire organization
CIS allows you to enforce 2-Factor Authentication. This extra element of security can prevent unauthorized access to your CIS console.

1. First, go to the upper right hand corner and select your **Organization Settings**. 
2. From the main Organization Page, you’ll see Enforce 2-Factor Authentication. Select it to engage the new level of security.

## Submit a test ticket with our support team
